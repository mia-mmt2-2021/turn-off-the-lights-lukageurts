## The assignment

Create a copy of your latest local *Nighty night* sketch. 

When you click once in the canvas, some (not all) windows turn dark.

You don't have to switch lights with continuous clicks (yet :smile: ).

Tip: variables can be globally or locally declared. If variables are declared inside of a function, they are local variables and they can not be accessed outside of that function. So in this assignment you need to change the variable used for the window coloring to a **global** variable.  

The result should look like this:
